    "# A Pythonic Exploration of Linear Algebra: Scalars, Vectors, Matrices, and Tensors\n",
    "**by Lorenzo Arcioni**\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of vector spaces and linear transformations between them. It provides the fundamental tools and concepts for analyzing systems of linear equations, solving problems in geometry, and studying the properties of mathematical objects such as scalars, vectors, matrices, and tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scalars\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalars are elements of a field, such as ℝ, representing quantities that possess only magnitude, such as temperature, mass, distance, or time. Scalars have zero dimensions, and they are considered point values in a mathematical space. Typically denoted by lowercase letters (e.g., a, b, c), scalars are treated as constants. They can be real numbers, complex numbers, or elements from other mathematical fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s now represent a scalar in Python using the well known mathematical library NumPy."
