    "# A Pythonic Exploration of Linear Algebra: Object Addition\n",
    "**by Lorenzo Arcioni**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exploration, we dive into the core concept of object addition, an essential operation that lies at the heart of linear algebra, paving the way for a deeper understanding of mathematical structures and their real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalar, vector, matrix, and tensor addition are fundamental operations that extend beyond mere mathematical operations; they are the building blocks for solving complex problems in various scientific and computational domains. Through the lens of NumPy, we embark on a journey to discover the elegance and efficiency with which we can perform these operations in a Pythonic manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to mathematical theory, it is only possible to add two objects (scalars, vectors, matrices, and tensors) if and only if they have the same shape, meaning they have the same dimensions and the same number of elements for each dimension. But we will see that when we operate with NumPy, this rule does not always apply! In fact, in certain cases, we can add two objects even if they have different shapes."

    "We explored the concept of algebraic object addition, delving into scalar, vector, matrix, and tensor additions using the versatile NumPy library in Python. We witnessed how these operations are performed element-wise, and we demonstrated examples showcasing the flexibility of handling objects with different shapes. It's crucial to note that these fundamental algebraic operations serve as the building blocks for various mathematical and computational concepts, particularly in the realm of Machine Learning.\n",
