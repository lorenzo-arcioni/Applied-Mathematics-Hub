# Introduction {}

Linear algebra is the study of vectors and certain
rules to manipulate vectors.

In general, vectors are special objects that can be added together and
multiplied by scalars to produce another object of the same kind. From
an abstract mathematical viewpoint, any object that satisfies these two
properties can be considered a vector. 
<b>BOLD</b>
For example: $\vec{a}, \vec{b} \in \mathbb{R}^3$ are vectors:

$$\LARGE 
\sum_{i=0}^{\mathbb{N}}
$$
